# budget
Simple budget calculator

Enter your monthly salary or wage, then begin entering your expenses. Remaining budget will be displayed totally, or individually based on category.

Some styling needs to be improved to accomodate longer text added to expenses.

This project takes your income and expenses and gives you the remaining amount. It also displays your expenses neatly in a list. In JS the expenses added are added to an array
and it appends the information as a div in the expense list.

Modify and Delete button are working now.
